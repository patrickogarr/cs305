# cs305For this project, Artemis Financial, uses a RESTful web application to manage sensitive customer data. It required identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities in the software. I conducted a thorough assessment using both automated tools and manual reviews, then provided solutions to address the issues while ensuring the application remained functional and secure. Secure coding was a key focus, as it protects user data, builds trust, and helps prevent security breaches. One challenge in the project was choosing the right tools and mitigation techniques, which helped me better understand layered security. I improved the app by adding input validation, updating dependencies, and using tools like dependency checks. After refactoring the code, I tested it to ensure no new vulnerabilities were introduced. This project gave me hands-on experience in secure development, and I can use the final report and code updates as examples of my skills for future employers.
